# Map of Rome Path Finder
The Map of Rome Path Finder is a Java based desktop application that allows the user to import an <br>
image of a city in a bird's eye view perspective, and the program allows the user to create paths on <br>
the map. <br>
<br>
An example of a map that is compatible with this software is the following.<br>
